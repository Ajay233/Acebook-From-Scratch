# Acebook

The aim for this project is to create a facebook clone from scratch which will incorporate a springboot API 
to provide data such as user details, posts, likes and comments.  A React front end will make requests to the API for 
the data use then use the data and use this to render the relevant component views.

## Planned Tech Stack:
For building the front end:
- React
- JavaScript (including ES6)

For building the API
- Java
- Spring Boot

For perisiting data:
- Postgres

Testing
- JUnit for testing classes and methods
- Mockito
- Postman (for testing and mocking API endpoints)
- Swagger (for viewing the API endpoints)
